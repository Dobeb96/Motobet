<h1>So how does it work?</h1>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 5em; text-align: justify">
<p>When it comes to <strong>betting on <b>Moto GP</b>, <b>Moto 2</b>, <b>Moto 3</b> and <b>Formula 1</b></strong> we have developed a proprietary <strong>program</strong> that predicts the results from these disciplines. The program is based on analyzing riders tendencies to be better or worse in qualifications and race, compared to the results from trainings. Technically it's not too complicated, and it's effectiveness you can judge on your own checking <strong>Formula 1 or Moto GP sections.</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 3em">While <strong>betting on <b>basketball</b></strong> we use some help from <a href="http://www.progsport.com">an online source that already offers <strong>computed predictions on basketball</strong></a>. We then run this data through our own filters that we believe deliver better results, and that's how we offer you even more precise suggestions.</p>

<p>Together we are trying to offer you a service giving you the best possible bets with every detail mathematically analyzed. We are working on <b>programs that use statistics</b> to call out win rate %. Our main goal is to make the site more available and more advanced with the time that passes. We would love to hear from you any kind of opinion or recommendation.</p>

<p>Have a nice stay<br>
