  <p style="padding-left: 3em">In his <strong>betting</strong> Maciej is most of the time risk averse, looking for real deals, believing in consistent and mathematical approach to betting. He is the one keeping an eye on <strong>Moto GP</strong>, <strong>Moto 2</strong>, <strong>Moto 3</strong>, <strong>Formula 1</strong> and <strong>basketball</strong> sections. Though it can be dangerous, he believes that numbers can reveal so much information that it's not even important to watch the particular sport to bet correctly (though he indeed watches MotoGP with delight). You can check his results in any of the <strong>motorsport</strong> or <strong>basketball</strong> sections.

  <p style="padding-right: 3em">Mike, on the other hand has a lot of expierience in the <strong>eSport scene</strong>, especially Dota 2 and CS:GO where the possibility of upsets can be much higher than in normal football matches. His strategy is to use small bankroll amount in order to get highest possible reward. Usually it takes a bit of time before the jackpot can be reached, but usually covers all the losses and gets nice reward as well. On the other hand he likes to bulid a bankroll with safer and logical statically wise bets. Those bets are usually made in football section.</p>
